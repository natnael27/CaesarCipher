# CAESAR CIPHER
Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that is named after Julius Caesar, who is said to have used this technique to encode his private messages. 
In this technique, each letter in the plaintext message is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, if the fixed number is 3, then 'A' would be replaced by 'D', 'B' would become 'E', and so on.
